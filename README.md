Description:
Analysis and correlation of Avengers-inspired dog names over time compared to Marvel Avengers movie releases timing.

Conclusion:
The Marvel Avengers series has been one of the most popular and prolific movie franchises in the last few decades. 
As such, the influence we have seen on pop culture trends for things like baby names and other areas, trickles down even to other areas, influencing dog name choices. 
We were able to compare those popular movies by release date to dog name trends over time.  
There were visible correlations for the dog Avengers-inspired character names and the release dates of the most popular Marvel movie characters, resulting in spikes in those new dog name registrations. 
Based on our analysis, it appears that the Thor series of Avengers movies had the most influence on dog names in the state of New York during that timeframe.
